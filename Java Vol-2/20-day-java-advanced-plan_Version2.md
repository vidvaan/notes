# 20-Day Java Advanced Learning Plan: Exception Handling, Collections, Java 8 Features & JDBC
This 20-day plan will give you a deep dive into three crucial areas of Core Java: **Exception Handling**, the **Java Collections Framework**, **Java 8 Features** (lambdas, streams, functional interfaces, etc.) and **JDBC**. Each day includes focused topics, practical exercises, and suggested mini-projects.

- Nested try-catch  
- Exception propagation

**Day 3:** Custom Exceptions  
- Creating user-defined exceptions  
- Using `throw` and `throws`  
- Best practices for custom exceptions

**Day 4:** Exception Handling Best Practices  
- Catching vs. rethrowing  
- Resource management  
- Using `finally`  
- Try-with-resources

**Day 5:** Real-World Exception Scenarios  
- Exception handling in file I/O  
- Exception handling in collections and streams  
- Logging exceptions

## **Week 2: Collections Framework In-depth**

**Day 6:** Collections Framework Overview  
- What is the Collections Framework?  
- Core interfaces: Collection, List, Set, Map, Queue  
- Common implementations overview

**Day 7:** List Interface and Implementations  
- ArrayList vs. LinkedList  
- List methods and performance  
- Iteration, sorting, searching

**Day 8:** Set Interface and Implementations  
- HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet  
- Set operations and uniqueness  
- Comparators and ordering

**Day 9:** Map Interface and Implementations  
- HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap  
- Map methods, key-value storage  
- Iterating over maps

**Day 10:** Queue & Deque  
- Queue, PriorityQueue, LinkedList as Queue  
- Deque, ArrayDeque  
- Use cases: task scheduling, buffering

**Day 11:** Collections Utility Classes  
- `Collections` and `Arrays` utility methods  
- Sorting, searching, shuffling  
- Synchronized collections  
- Immutable collections

**Day 12:** Generics and Type Safety  
- Why generics?  
- Creating generic classes and methods  
- Bounded types  
- Wildcards (`?`, `extends`, `super`)

**Day 13:** Collections in Practice  
- Designing data structures with collections  
- Nested collections (e.g., Map of Lists)  
- Mini-project: Simple To-Do List Manager or Student Directory

**Tips:**
- Code daily and review your work.
- Build small projects or exercises for each major topic.
- Use official documentation and trusted resources for deeper learning.
