# Day 2: Text & Formatting

Welcome to Day 2! Today, you'll learn how to structure and format text on your web page using HTML. We'll cover headings, paragraphs, bold and italic text, lists, and line breaks.

## 1. Headings

HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important):

```html
<h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is a Heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is a Heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is a Heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is a Heading 6</h6>
```

## 2. Paragraphs

Use the `<p>` tag to define paragraphs:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

---

## 3. Bold and Italics

- **Bold:** Use `<b>` or `<strong>`.  
  Example:
  ```html
  <b>Bold Text</b> or <strong>Strong Importance</strong>
  ```

- _Italics:_ Use `<i>` or `<em>`.  
  Example:
  ```html
  <i>Italic Text</i> or <em>Emphasized Text</em>
  ```

## 4. Lists

### Ordered List (Numbered)

```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

### Unordered List (Bulleted)

```html
<ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
  <li>Cherry</li>
</ul>
```

---

## 5. Line Breaks

Use the `<br>` tag to insert a line break (no closing tag required):

```html
<p>This is line one.<br>This is line two.</p>
```
