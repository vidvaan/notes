## 1. What is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications.  
- **HyperText:** Refers to the links that connect web pages to one another.
- **Markup Language:** Uses tags to define elements within a document.

**Why is HTML important?**  
HTML provides the basic structure of a website, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.

## 2. Structure of a Web Page

A basic HTML document looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Main content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

**Elements explained:**
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element of the HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document (like its title).
- `<title>`: The title shown in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains all the visible content of the page.

## 3. Install a Code Editor

To write and edit HTML (and later CSS/JavaScript), you need a code editor. Here are some popular choices:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows)

**Recommended:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)  
Download and install your preferred editor.
