# Day 29: Final Project - Plan & Start

Congratulations, youâ€™ve made it to your **final project**! Today is all about choosing your project, planning its features, and setting up the basic structure so you can start building.

## 1. Choose Your Project

Pick a project idea that excites you and lets you use what you've learned. Here are some options (or invent your own):

- **Personal Portfolio Website**: Showcase your work and introduce yourself.
- **Interactive Quiz App**: Ask questions, collect answers, and show scores.
- **Advanced To-Do List**: Add, edit, remove, and save tasks (with localStorage).
- **Simple Blog**: Create, view, and delete posts.
- **Notes App**: Write and save notes.
- **Calculator Plus**: Do more than basic math (history, themes, etc.).
- **Mini Game**: Like Tic-Tac-Toe, Rock-Paper-Scissors, or a memory game.

**Write down your idea here:**

## 3. Sketch the Structure

Sketch out the main HTML structure (on paper or below):

```
Page Structure:
- Header with app name
- Main area for content (questions, tasks, etc.)
- Buttons for actions (submit, next, add task, etc.)
```

## 4. Set Up Your Project

Create your project folder and files:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`
- (Optional) `README.md`

**Basic Boilerplate:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Final Project</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>My Final Project</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <!-- Content goes here -->
    </main>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Start with basic HTML and CSS layout.**  
Add some placeholder elements if you like.

## 5. Begin Coding ðŸš€
