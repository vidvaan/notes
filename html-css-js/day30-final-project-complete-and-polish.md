## 5. Reflect & Celebrate!

- Look at how much you‚Äôve learned: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, localStorage, events, validation, and more.
- Write a short reflection:
  - What are you most proud of?
  - What was hardest? How did you solve it?
  - What do you want to learn next?

**Reflection Example:**
```
I'm proud of building a working quiz app with localStorage for scores! The hardest part was debugging event listeners, but I fixed it by re-reading Day 24. Next, I want to learn about deploying my site and try a JS framework like React or Vue.
```

## 6. Plan Your Next Steps

- **Deploy your site:** Try GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
