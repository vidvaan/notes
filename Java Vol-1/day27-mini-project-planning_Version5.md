# Day 27: Mini Project Planning

Congratulations on reaching Day 27! Today, you'll plan a **mini project** that brings together the Java concepts you've learned so far. This step focuses on choosing a project, planning its features, and outlining the code structure.

---

## 1. Choosing a Project

Pick a simple project that interests you and is practical for your current skillset. Here are some popular options:
- **Student Management System**
- **Library Management System**
- **Simple Calculator**
- **To-Do List Application**
- **Contact Book**
- **Bank Account Manager**

> **Tip:** Student Management or Library System are great for practicing OOP, Collections, File I/O, and basic user interaction.

## 2. Example Project: Student Management System

We'll use this as an example, but feel free to choose your own!

---

## 3. Feature Planning

List the core features your project should have. For a Student Management System:

- Add a new student
- View all students
- Search for a student by ID or name
- Update student details
- Delete a student
- Save/load data from a file

**Optional Features:**
- Sort students by name or grade
- User authentication (login system)
- Export data

---

## 4. Sketching the Structure

### a. Main Classes

- `Student`: Represents a student (fields: id, name, age, grade, etc.)
- `StudentManager`: Handles operations (add, update, delete, search, list)
- `Main`: Contains the main method and user menu

### b. Data Storage

- Use an `ArrayList<Student>` to store students in memory.
- Use File I/O to persist data between runs (e.g., using serialization or writing in CSV/text format).

### c. Menu-Driven Console UI

- Present options to the user and perform actions based on their input.

## 5. Sample Class Outline

```java
class Student {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private double grade;
    // Getters, setters, constructors, toString(), etc.
}

class StudentManager {
    private ArrayList<Student> students;
    // Methods: addStudent(), viewStudents(), searchStudent(), updateStudent(), deleteStudent(), saveToFile(), loadFromFile()
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Show menu, take input, call StudentManager methods
    }
}
```

## 6. Planning Steps

1. **Define requirements and features.**
2. **Design classes and data structures.**
3. **Plan file formats for saving/loading data.**
4. **Sketch user interaction flow (menu/commands).**
5. **Divide tasks into small steps for implementation.**

---

## 7. Tips for Success

- Start with core features; add extras after your main flow works.
- Use OOP principles: encapsulate data, use classes.
- Handle edge cases (duplicate IDs, empty lists, etc.).
- Use exception handling for robust File I/O.
